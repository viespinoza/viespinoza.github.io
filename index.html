            <h4>Prologue</h4>
            <h2>A Changing Region</h2>
            <p>
            Latin America and the Caribbean is a changing region. Its democracies have matured, its institutions are being modernized and its citizens are growing increasingly demanding for greater transparency and accountability. These changes have forged a new relationship between Governments, the Private Sector and Civil Society.</p>

            <p>In this context, the IDB Group emerges as a leader in development for Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), thanks to its privileged relationship with the different Governments, the Private Sector and Civil Society. The Group is permanently anticipating trends and supporting change in the region as a contribution to sustainable development from multiple perspectives.</p>

            <p>With an eye on the future, the Bank continues to reinforce its technical capacity to strengthen the planning and implementation of meaningful forms of engagement with Civil Society. This engagement is framed in the IDB Group’s contributions to the region’s economic and social development, which results from the strategic integration of the knowledge, perspectives, experiences and values of people, who are the direct beneficiaries of the Bank’s initiatives.</p>

            <p>The IDB Group works with Civil Society to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Contribute to the advancement of governments’ development agendas,</li> 
                <li>Support the best possible implementation of Private Sector initiatives, and</li> 
                <li>Strengthen Civil Society’s technical and participatory capacities.</li> 
            </ul>

            <p>This second review  of the IDB Group’s engagement with Civil Society shows how sector and operating specialists from the Bank’s different departments and divisions are conducting engagement actions and programs with civil society in 26 borrowing countries. Methodologically speaking, these actions are analyzed from five strategic levels of engagement:</p>  

            <ul>
                <li>Internal capacity to capture and provide access to <span class="strong"> information.</span> </li>
                <li>Establishment of forums for direct <span class="strong"> dialogue</span> with Civil Society. </li>
                <li>Public <span class="strong"> consultation</span> processes. </li>
                <li>Spaces for <span class="strong"> collaboration</span> with Civil Society. </li>
                <li>Strategic <span class="strong"> partnerships</span> with Civil Society. </li>
            </ul>

           <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <h2>The Regional Context</h2>
            <p>In recent decades, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) has undergone numerous transformations, among which we can mention: a) a growing maturity of the democratic systems across the region; b) the advent of initiatives that seek to increase transparency and accountability in government management; c) the global adoption of new technologies and social media; d) a strengthening of citizen participation in public affairs; and e) closer collaboration between Civil Society and the Private Sector.</p> 
            <p>Along this line, the ways in which Civil Society engages with the Government and the Private Sector have been a source of social innovation, understood as a participatory process that includes the creation, incorporation and dissemination of new social practices that have arisen together with two dynamic factors: the so-called “motivators” and “triggers” of participation.</p>
              
        </div>

        <div class="half second" id="insight2">
            <h4></h4>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>Among the motivators we can cite:  (i) economic growth and the expansion of public services; (ii) the change of paradigm towards greater transparency in Private Sector operations; (iii) the emergence of a middle class that is increasingly demanding for more and better services; (iv) the expansion of education and communication, which has resulted in citizens who are better educated and aware of rights and services; and (v) the advent of new technologies and the ubiquitous use of social media.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, triggers of citizen participation include: (i) the scandals of corruption that have shaken the Public and Private sectors; (ii) the lack of transparency and the rampant impunity; (iii) the low quality and high cost of public services.</p>

            <h4>General IDB Group Review</h4>
            <h2>Overview of the LAC Region</h2>
            <p>In response to the regional context and as a future practice, the IDB has established three objectives for its engagement with Civil Society that seek to maximize the joint contribution to the development of Governments, the Private Sector and Civil Society itself.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>leverage the expertise and consolidate the IDB Group’s engagement with Civil Society to help the Governments in the region advance their development agendas in consonance with the Bank's Country Strategies; </li>
                <li>strengthen Civil Society’s institutional and participatory capacity in order to help improve the design and implementation of country development agendas.
                <li>value the IDB Group’s experience and engagement with Civil Society as a way to maximize the impact of Private Sector project and initiative implementation on development.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In an effort to achieve these objectives within the period studied, the IDB Group, through the country offices of its 26 borrowing members, conducted more than 500 local engagement actions with Civil Society in the five strategic levels mentioned above.</p> 
            <p>The review revealed that, operationally speaking, 30% of all activities consisted of Partnerships with CSOs for the implementation of project components and/or technical cooperations, i.e. a 3% increase compared to the number of partnerships conducted in the previous period (2014-2015).

            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <h2 class="clean">About The Report</h2>
            <p><span class="strong">CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT:</span> The Bank has gained experience and enriched its activities thanks to the bulk of lessons learned during its operating and sector-based activities and the generation of knowledge. As mentioned earlier, in order to systematize the many experiences and lessons learned, the Bank’s actions with Civil Society have been methodologically analyzed from five different levels of engagement: information, dialogues, consultations, collaboration and partnerships.</p>
            <p><span class="strong">INFORMATION PROCESSING:</span> The information in this review comes from the work conducted in the 26 countries and systematized in accordance with the actions pertaining to each strategic level.</p>  
            </p><span class="strong">NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE REVIEW:</span> This exercise reflects the work conducted by the Bank in conjunction with Civil Society. This new edition seeks to guide the work in terms of the financial and human resources available. However, this review does not constitute a detailed account of all the projects, programs and activities that involve Civil Society participation in one or more levels of engagement (see the chart “Engagement Level by Activity”). Instead, its goal is to provide an initial insight to promote the measurement of the added value of such actions for the future development of activities and engagement with Civil Society.</p>
            </p><span class="strong">CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF THE INFORMATION BY COUNTRY:</span> This review is to be understood in context and not as a comparison between countries. The reason is that individual country activities are dependent upon the volume of operations and the impact of external and internal factors that result, among other causes, from changes in work teams and their short-term impact on CS-related topics. Also, by definition each country has a context and identity of its own that determine the interaction between the three main actors, which varies significantly from country to country. Accordingly, each Country Office is taking the steps needed to comply more efficiently with the Country Strategy agreed to with the respective government, promoting opportunities for development by incorporating CSOs that can contribute specific local and technical knowledge, if deemed pertinent.</p>
