            <h4>Prologue</h4>
            <h2>A Changing Region</h2>
            <p>
            The IDB Group is the leading development agency in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our focus is to improve the lives of citizens in Latin America and the Caribbean by continuously strengthen strategies and identifying new development trends. We at the IDB believe that the most important actors for development are Governments, Private Sectors and Civil Society.</p>

            <p>Latin America and the Caribbean are changing. The region’s democracies have matured and its institutions are being modernized. Its citizens demand greater transparency and accountability. These changes have forged a new relationship between Governments, the Private Sector and Civil Society.</p>

            <p>With Civil Society the IDB Group works to contribute to the advancement of governments’ development agendas, support the best implementation of private sector initiatives, and strengthen civil society’s technical and participatory capacities. This second review of Civil Society activities remarks how Civil Society operates and conducts programs in 26 member countries through five strategic lines of action aimed at: a) strengthening and promoting capacities to access and generate information; b) fostering constructive dialogue to achieve shared-value agendas; c) strengthening capacities and instruments for due diligence in public consultations; d) identifying and supporting opportunities for collaboration that generate knowledge; e) leveraging partnerships to multiply resources and reach more beneficiaries.</p>

            <p>Civil Society is one of the main actors towards development. The gradual involvement and strengthening of Civil Society has allowed citizens to become more aware of the importance of a true accountability. Therefore, a better and organized civil society is needed to allow citizens to be firmer in their demand for proper services and accountability for their leaders.</p>

            <p>This review constitutes a vital step to better understand Civil Society Engagement in the region. This work led by the Bank is indispensable to provide pertinent information needed for future endeavors. In this report, we will see the operations led by the Bank where Civil Society provides an indispensable step needed for future endeavors.</p>              

            <p>We hope you find the IDB-Civil Society Engagement Review 2016-2017 insightful and download the full report <a href="https://publications.iadb.org/handle/11319/7496?locale-attribute=en&locale-attribute=es&" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

           <h4>Introduction</h4>
            <h2>Scope, Reach & Impact</h2>
            <p>This second review under the leadership of the Vice President for Countries, Alexandre Meira da Rosa, looks to clarify the scope, reach and impact of the work of the different Bank sectors, departments, divisions and units conduct with CS, as well as to optimize the use of resources available. These actions can be summarized in:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>Including CS as part of a set of innovative solutions for effectively addressing development challenges identified by the Bank by incorporating human capital with technically prepared Civil Society Organizations (CSO);</li>
                <li>Increase added value in a regional thematic roundtable in order to build knowledge during regional meetings, with a view to prepare common agendas on development challenges identified in the Region.</li>  
            </ul>
            <p>At a regional level, Civil Society Consultative Groups (ConSoc) continued to be strengthened in all 26 countries. These groups represent an invaluable network of collaboration and direct interaction with the Bank in the form of technical and territorial perspectives and experiences.</p>

            <h4></h4>
            <h2></h2>
            <p>Also, the annual regional meetings ‘’IDB Group–Civil Society Caribbean Forum’’ and ‘’IDB Group-Civil Society Regional Forum’’ were also reinforced and executed in Trinidad and Tobago and the Dominican Republic (2016) and in Jamaica and Bolivia (2017) and respectively. These meetings include the participation of CSO leaders, experts on different fields and sector, and Bank specialist to explore opportunities for joint solutions.</p>  
            <p>The previous considerations explain the need for a biennial review that helps to better understand the IDB Group’s level of engagement with Civil Society, draw lessons learned and to coordinate the Bank’s future actions. Note that the review supports and highlights the work of IDB Group Civil Society in each of the 26 borrowing member countries of the region: Argentina, Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela.

            <h4>Methodology</h4>
            <h2 class="clean">About The Report</h2>
            <p>A. CONCEPTUALIZATION OF THE LEVELS OF ENGAGEMENT: The IDB Group has gained experience and enriched its work with a range of activities and lessons learned in the context of its operational-sectoral work and the generation of knowledge. In order to systematize this universe of experiences, the IDB Group has adopted Bank's work with Civil Society has been analyzed from five different action approaches: information, dialogues, consultations, collaboration and alliances. The division into five strategic lines of action was conceived based on the examination of the IDB Group's work with Civil Society (SC), in addition to a comprehensive and systematic process of public consultations and internal consultations that begun in 2016 and continued through 2017 with meetings, interviews and virtual and face-to-face consultations. This process was carried out by the IDB Group Civil Society Team as part of the update to its Strategy for the Relationship with Civil Society and resulted in updated and more refined definitions of each level.</p>
            <p>B. INFORMATION PROCESSING: The information from the 26 countries was received in collaboration with Civil Society Liaisons and Specialists in IDB Country Offices. The inputs from each country were processed and organized at the IDB Headquarters in Washington, DC into the corresponding levels. Countries also highlighted their success stories in one or more of the strategic lines of action to illustrate how the different levels of engagement have been put into practice.</p>  
            </p>C. NATURE AND SCOPE OF THE REVIEW: This exercise seeks to highlight the Bank’s enormous and outstanding efforts with the third actor of development –Civil Society– and to better coordinate present and future development opportunities. Far from being an exhaustive inventory of the projects, programs and activities involving CS participation in one or more levels of engagement, the review provides updated guidelines for designing CS-related activities and engagement strategies in the future.</p>
            </p>D. CONTEXTUAL ANALYSIS OF THE INFORMATION BY COUNTRY: This review is to be understood in context and not as a comparison between countries. The reason is that individual country activities are dependent upon the volume of the operations portfolio and the influence of external and internal factors that result, for example, from changes in work teams and their short-term impact on CS-related topics. Also, by definition, each country has its own context and identity that determine the interaction between the three main actors, which, as we will see, varies significantly from country to country. Accordingly, each Country Office takes the steps needed to increase compliance efficiency in line with the Country Strategy agreed with the respective government, promoting opportunities for development by incorporating CSOs that can contribute specific local and technical knowledge, if deemed pertinent.</p>
